This is my deconstruction of a project built by Mary Lou at the link https://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/04/17/slide-and-push-menus/

A pretty helpful reusable code there.
Lets first break down the .js files in it.

CLASSIE.JS:
Uses a built-in base class of javascript called "Element".The code in this file has some simple regex,but the project runs just as perfect 
even without it.
Only,two objects "classList" and "className" from the Element class are used.
